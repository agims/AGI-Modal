# AGI Modal
This is a WordPress Plugin that allows you to have a modal window pop up at a specified place on the page.  It works better than it sounds.  :)

## Latest Version:
1.3 - Cleburne

## Synopsis
The AGI Modal plugin is a modal plugin for WordPress based on [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com)'s modal plugin.  It's been modified so as to not conflict with the namespace of other plugins and is in constant development.  It was first developed as a proof of concept and has since been developed mainly at [AGI Marketing](http://www.agims.com).

The plugin is set up to be used either with straight HTML code for the content or with a shortcode from another plugin.  At AGI, we mainly use it in conjunction with the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin, with the layout and forms handled by that plugin and the popup itself handled by this plugin.

## Installation
We prefer using the [github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin from afragen as it makes updates SO much easier.  However if you prefer you can also download it from here as a zip file and then within WordPress go to Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin.

## Usage
The plugin is pretty straight-forward.  You can find the options page at Settings -> AGI Modal Options.
